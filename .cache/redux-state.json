An important part is that y comes from a fully specified parameteric DGP, which has a k-dimensional parameter vector $$\\theta$$. From that, we can define a density function \n\n$$f(y|\\theta)$$ \n\nwhich is y as a function of $$\\theta$$. We can define a likelihood as the PDF where we now look at $$\\theta$$ as a function of y.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimator of $$\\theta$$ is\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} = argmax_{\\theta \\in \\Theta}f(y|\\theta).\n$$\n\nIn other words, the $$\\theta$$ that maximizes the likelihood.\n\n##### Likelihood Function\n\nThe likelihood function under the assumption of i.i.d sampling is the product of likelihoods. \n$$\nf(y|\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^nf_i(y_i|\\theta,y_1,...,y_{i-1}).\n$$\n\n\nEach $$f_i$$ is the likelihood contribution of the i-th observation.

In particular, this arises when we have intractable integrals, like in the case of each likelihood looking:\n\n$$\nf(y_i|\\theta) = \\int_{\\mathcal{D}}v(y_i|\\theta,\\eta_i)p(\\eta_i)d\\eta\n$$\n\nwith p being the density function with support $$\\mathcal{D}$$. v(.) is the density of $$y_i$$ assuming both $$\\theta$$ and $$\\eta_i$$ are known. Simulated Maximum Likelihood approximates the integral using $$\\textbf{monte carlo integration}$$, where we hope that the Monte Carlo error isn't too bad. Note that we are given a distribution with PDF $$p(\\eta_i)$$ which we want to use. From that, there is usually only 1 choice of a function v(.) that works well with it, notice that this does not mean there is an unique v(.), just an \"optimal\" v(.).

        "content": "\n# Introduction to Simulation Techniques\n## Why Simulations?\n\nBefore we begin, we first ask why do we even need computational techniques. An answer to this is that there are many reasons why we need computational techniques, as they can help us in scenarios such as\n\n- When we can't always trust asymptotic results in finite samples;\n- When we can't trust assumptions underlying our models;\n- When we want to run methods that have not been coded up.\n\n\nFurthermore, on the topic of simulations, we need simulations when we need to be able to generate draws from distributions. There are many practical applications to this such as simulating random terms in time series, constructing random samples, and more. However, sampling from distributions other than the uniform tend to be quite difficult, due to many reasons as we will soon discover. Furthermore, when you construct distributions yourself that are not currently written in Python or R, it is useful to write your own methods to sample from your own distributions. \n\n\nWe look at some examples of computational techniques. Alot of times we require computational techniques for expressions that do not have analytical expressions. In particular, we focus on 2 techniques, simulation and numerical integration. \n\n--- \n\n## Numerical Integration\nWe have a function h(x) which we seek to evaluate at a grid of points x. We then use those values to approximate h by a piecewise linear function, which we can integrate exactly in order to find an approximation to $$\\int_{x \\in D}h(x)dx$$. Keep this integral in mind as we will spend the rest of this chapter on finding out how to evaluate this integral. Such examples of this include both midpoint and trapezoid rule. These algorithms converge quickly in low dimension with bounded domains.\n\nThe issue is for high-dimensional problems, we suffer from the curse of dimensionality, as we try to cover too much of the space. Hence, such techniques do not scale well. For example, if we get 4 grid points for each dimension, so only 4 points along each axis, we would already have $$4^10$$ points to sample and that is already massive for such a poor performance. Instead, sampling random points is more efficient, that is, if the space was $$R^{10}$$, we would sample vectors with 10 components and evaluate them accordingly. The issue is that this does not work really well. Hence, we turn to Monte Carlo integration instead.\n\n---\n\n## Monte Carlo Integration\nRecall that expectations for density functions of continuous random variables are just integrals, hence, we try to write our integrals as an expectation. Then finding the expectation is equivalent to evaluating the integral, except that computing expectations are much easier to do.\n\nFirst we need to recall some properties of density functions f, on the domain $$\\mathbb{D}$$.\n\n- f is never negative;\n- $$\\int_{x \\in D}f(x)dx = 1$$;\n- Some properties of smoothness. \n\n\nThen, we need to recall the _Law of the Unconscious Statistician_ that states that if we want to calculate the $$\\textbf{expected value}$$ of a function g(X) for the random variable X, if we know the probability distribution of X but not g(X), we can simply compute \n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}(g(X)) = \\int_{\\infty}^{\\infty}g(x)f_X(x)dx\n$$ \n\nand this still works in giving us the expectation of X.\n\nSo now, if we are interested in evaluating the integral\n$$\n\\int_{x \\in \\mathbb{D}}h(x)dx\n$$\nwe re-express h(x) as\n$$\nh(x) = v(x)f(x)\n$$\nwhere f(x) is a density function on the domain D and then we simply define v to be h\\f.\n\nBringing it all together, we have that \n\n$$\n\\int_{x \\in \\mathbb{D}}h(x)dx = \\int_{x \\in \\mathbb{D}}v(x)f(x)dv = \\mathbb{E}[v(X)]\n$$\n\nwhere X is a random variable with density funcction f. Furthermore, the last equality is just the application of LOTUS. Hence, we have just written our integral of h(.) as an expectation of a random variable X, with a density function f(.), that relates to h(.). \n\nFor a quick high level overview, since we need to find E[v(X)] in order to compute the integral of h(.), recall that expectations are simply averages, so all we need to do is sample multiple v(x) for x in D (over the same domain as the integral of interest h), and simply take the average of these v(x) values. We have just computed E[v(X)] and therefore the integral of h(x)! In particular, what we do is that we take draws x1, x2, ..., xS from the density function f and then\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[v(X)] = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^Sv(x_i).\n$$\n\nSo we take draws from f and evaluate v(.) on it.\n\nIn particular, we hope that the density f() that we have chose is one that is very easy to sample from. From this, we can have multiple draws from that distribution and therefore the expectation of v(.). \n\nIn terms of theoretical justifications for this, recall that the $$\\textbf{weak law of large numbers}$$ (Khinchin's Law) states that the sample average $$\\textbf{converges in probability}$$ towards the expected value for a sequence of random variables that are i.i.d and whose first moment exists. Convergence in probability is that the probability of an unusual outcome becomes smaller and smaller as the sequence progresses, or in other words\n\n$$\nlim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}Pr(|X_n - X| > \\epsilon) = 0\n$$\n\nfor a sequence of random variables $$\\{X_n\\}$$ and all $$\\epsilon > 0$$. Therefore, the WLLN can then be expressed as\n\n$$\nlim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty}Pr(|\\bar{X}_n - \\mu| > \\epsilon) = 0,\n$$\n\nwhere $$\\mu$$ is the expected value and $$\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + ... + X_n)$$. Hence, going back to our scenario, as long as v(x) is a sequence of Lebesgue integrable random variables (which means that their expected value exists and is finite), we have that\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{S}\\sum_{k=1}^Sv(x^{(s)}) \\rightarrow E[v(X)] = \\int_{X \\in \\mathbb{D}}h(x)dx.\n$$\n\nHence, we see that this converges to our integral of interest as number of draws from f increases or $$S \\rightarrow \\infty$$. An important thing to note is that unlike most cases of asymptotics, we actually have control over S and hence we can keep simulating to ensure we get the integral of interest!\n\n---\n\nStay tuned on how can we sample from distributions in order to compute these integrals!\n",

Usually, what this means is that we have objects whose states changes over time (e.g. pokemon object is levelling up)\n\nSometimes, we can design programs which can solve things purely through functions. tl;dr: when we don't need objects to design the program. This is where Functional programming comes into play!\n\n---\n\n## Let's get into it!\n\nFunctional programming is STATELESS aka they rely only on their given inputs to produce an output.\n\nSo here's an example. We first create a global variable `X`.\n```python\nX = 5\n```\n\nWe then have the 2 following functions.\n```python\ndef non_func_sum(y):\n    return y + X\n\ndef func_sum(x, y):\n    return x + y\n```\nThese obviously will give us the same answer if we let x=X=5 and y=10. However, the first function uses a global variable (a state) to compute it whilst the second one doesn't. Hence, the second function is an example of functional programming. Pure functions have the advantage of not suffering from side effects of states occurring (e.g. if you accidently change X, you're in trouble).\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, we need to make a quick detour in lambda expressions which are a good example of functional programming and will see how all this is pratical.\n\n---\n\n## Lambda Functions\n\nLambda functions are anonymous functions. In other words, they are functions that don't have a name :( \n\nGenerally, they tend to be a 1 line function which then can be used within other functions to do things.\n\n#### Let's write our own lambda function!\n\nIf we wanted to write a function that takes in a number and adds 10, we normally go:\n```python\ndef add_ten(x):\n  return x + 10\n```\n\nThis is a a bit tedious and kinda of a waste of code to write. We can be more concise with this by going:\n\n```python\nlambda x: x + 10\nlambda x,y: x+y\n```\n\nThis creates a lambda function where we take in a variable x and return x+10. Hence, the keyword lambda here lets Python know we are defining a lambda function, the new few variable before the : are the arguments for our lambda function, and the expression after the : is the code we execute for our lambda expression. Running this actually doesn't do anything. We need to actually assign it to a variable so we can start using it.\n\n```python\nma_new_func = lambda x: x + 10\n\nprint(ma_new_func(30))\n```\n> 40\n\nYay it works!. Note that we do not have to type the return command here (e.g. return x+10).\n\n---\n\n## Building things with lambda expressions.\n\nWe can also place lambda functions into other functions. The sort function can take in an argument on HOW you want the list to be sorted. Suppose we have the list of tuples like this: \n```python\nunsorted = [('b', 6), ('a', 10), ('d', 0), ('c', 4)]\n```\n\nLet's say we want to sort it by the characters and also another list sorted by integers. With lambda expressions, we can just go:\n\n```python\nprint(sorted(unsorted, key=lambda x: x[0]))\nprint(sorted(unsorted, key=lambda x: x[1]))\n```\n \nThe key part is the lambda function that helps us get the 0th or 1st index in the tuple which we then sort on.\n\n**So to summarise lambda functions, it has this form:**\n```python\n# lambda variable: operation to perform\n```\nAs you seen earlier, we can also have multiple arguments in our lambda expression by going:\n\n```python\nsum_func = lambda x, y: x + y \nprint(sum_func(10, 50))\n```\n\n---\n\n## Bringing it all together!\n\nWe have seem lambda functions and how we can put them into other functions. Now let's see what sorts of functions we can put these lambda functions into!\n\n### FILTER\nThis helps you to filter out a list\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n# We need a list or else we just get back a filter object.\na = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2, l))\nprint(a)\n```\n> [1, 3]\n\nOur new list a is a filtered list! Note that what we get back from our the filter function is actually a filter object, hence we turn it into a list by going list() in order to get back a list. This will be a common thread in other functions we will see shortly.\n\n### MAP\n\nApplies a function onto every element in our collection. It may be a bit trippy since we are passing in a function as a argument but that's valid! Functions that lets us do this is called a first-class function. So in particular, map takes in a collection and a function. It then applies that function on each element in that collection.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Map function\")\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\np = list(map(lambda x: x+1, l))\nprint(p)\n```\n> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nThe list has been updated! However, be aware of some caveats.\n\n```python\nx = list(map(lambda x: x+3, l))\nprint(l) # this is still the same... why... \n```\n> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nNote that the map function doesn't actually alter the original list. It gives us back a map object with the new altered list which we then turn into a list.\n\nNote that we can do a more pythonic way of this by using list comprehensions.\n```python\n# Map alternative.\nadd_10 = [x + 1 for x in l]\nprint(add_10)\n```\n\n### ZIP\nThis merges collections into tuples and this whole thing is an iterable!\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nk = [9, 8, 7, 6]\nz = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nf = zip(l, k, z)\nfor x in f:\n    print(x)\n```  \nThis is what each element from the iterator will expand to:\n    \n> f[0] = (1, 9)\n  f[1] = (2, 8)\n  f[2] = (3, 7)\n  f[3] = (4, 6)\n\nIn other words, we are doing something like this:\n```python\np = list([(1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6)])\n```\n\n### REDUCE\n\nReduce takes in an iterable and reduces it to a single value.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\nmy_list = [10,20,30,40]\nvalue = reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, my_list)\nprint(value)\n``` \n> 100\n\nWhat this does is that it:\n- Sums 10+20 = 30. \n- Then it does 30+30 = 60. \n- Finally 60+40 = 100.\n\nMax, min etc is an example of reduce as they take in an iterable and gives us back a single value.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nHopefully this post achieved 2 things.\n1. Beginners are able to take away some nifty little things or understand what's happening behind some of the functions they use.\n\n2. Actual functional programmers have not gone blind from reading this.\n\n### Credits: \n- https://www.dataquest.io/blog/introduction-functional-programming-python/\n- INFO1110 Course at USYD.",

        "content": "\n## Introduction\nA file is just a sequence of bytes. Everything in UNIX is a file. This is profoundly deep idea. Text files are files, directories are files, even commands like ls or pwd are just files. \n\nDisk storage allows us to provide persistent storage. The OS abstracts this to be known as files. These files are arranged into a tree by folder/directory structure. Whenever we want to read or write to a file, we do this through system calls.\n\nThe applications that the user interacts with are \"managed\" by the OS which then helps us interface with the hardware. Here, the OS doesn't trust the user and doesn't give them direct access to the hardware. System calls are ways for programs to talk to the hardware and through these system calls, we can set standards on how we want these interactions to occur.\n\nFor files, they aren't necessarily stored in contiguous memory but in fact distributed across the disk containing information on them. Devices themselves are also represented as files.\n\n---\n\n### Files\nA FILE is a struct that is defined in <stdio.h>. We have that feof() helps test whether are we at the end of file indicator. \n\nWhen we read stuff in, they can be either buffered (input/output accumulated into a block then passed) or unbuffered where we just pass input/output on right away.\n\n### File Pointers\nFile helps to store persistent data! Hence, when we terminate programs, we can still have information relating to the stuff we just did in that program. All file manipulation functions are inside <stdio.h>.  All of these require file pointers as arguments.\n\n#### fopen\nfopen(): This opens a file and returns a file pointer to it. We can check the return value of this and if it is NULL, then that means that file does not exist. Hence, we pass in a file and an operation we want to undertake.\n\n```C\nFILE* fp = fopen(<filename>, <operation>);\n\n// Operation can be \"w', \"r\", \"wb\", \"a\" etc depending on what mode you want to operate the file in.\n```\n\nWe now have a pointer called fp that points to our file.\n\nWhen we begin a program, special files are opened for us. These files are:\n1) stdin\n2) stdout\n3) stderr\n\n\n\n#### fclose\nTakes in a file pointer and closes the file. You should do this to be safe.\n\n```C\nfclose(<file pointer>);\n```\n\n#### fgetc\nThis means file, get a character. Get the next character of that file and store it into a variable.\n\n```C\nchar our_char = fgetc(<file pointer>);\n\n// Example\nchar our_char = fgetc(fp);\n```\n\nIn order for this to work, we should've have already opened the file pointer. Hence, we get the next character from our file.\n\nHence, with these 3 operations, we can now open a file and read in everything from it character by character:\n\n```C\nFILE *fp = fopen(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\");\n\nchar ch;\nwhile((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)\n{\n  printf(\"%c\\n\", ch);\n}\n```\nThis will keep getting the next character and printing it as long as it is not the EOF character. This is actually what the linux command cat does!\n\n#### fputc\nThis is the equivalent to writing/appending specific character to a file that's being pointed to. Note that the file pointer we pass in must be in either write or append more!\n\n```C\nfputc(<character>, <file pointer>);\n\n// Example\nfputc('c', fp);\n```\nSo now we can copy contents from one file over into another file using this new command to help us!\n\n```C\nFILE *fp = fopen(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\");\n\nchar ch;\nwhile((ch = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)\n{\n  fputc(ch, fp_two);\n}\n```\nThis writes it out into another file pointer! This is the cp command in linux!\n\n#### fread\nThis is similar to fgetc except now it's a generic form in which we can get _any_ amount of information we want. This reads in a quantity of memory where each is a certain size and stores them into a buffer.\n\n```C\nfread(<buffer>, <size>, <qty>, <file pointer>);\n// Note that file pointer must be in read mode!!\n```\nHence, an example could be, read 6 \"things\" of size 4 bytes each into a buffer. Hence, this is effectively asking us to read in 6 ints into our buffer as an int is 4 bytes. Hence, we can now read in an arbitrary amount of things and stores it into a buffer.\n\n```C\nint arr[10];\nfread(arr, sizeof(int), 10, file_pointer);\n```\nHence, this allows us to read in 10\\*sizeof(int) amount of information from the file_pointer and storing that temporarily into our buffer arr. Recall arr (an array) is just a pointer to the first element in our array and hence we are passing in a pointer when we do this. We could also pass in something that has been malloc'd for our buffer.\n\n```C\ndouble *arr2 = malloc(sizeof(double) * 80); // Creates an array of 80 elements.\nfread(arr2, sizeof(double), 80, file_pointer); // Reads in 80 doubles from our file and temporarily stores it into our buffer.\n\n// If we wanted to store it into a buffer like a character, then we need to do &character_variable.\n```\n\n#### fwrite\nThis is similar to fputc but now generic size! Similar idea to fread.\n\n```C\nint arr[10];\nfwrite(arr, sizeof(int), 10, ptr);\n// Note that ptr must be in write or append mode only.\n// Don't forget to flush too.\nfflush(ptr);\n```\n\n#### fseek\nThis allows you to move forward and backwards through the file.\n\n```C\nfseek(<file pointer>, <offset>, <whence>)\n\n// An example to go to the end of the file is\n\nfseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END); // We are now at the end!\n\nfseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET); // Move to start of the file!\n\nlong position = 10;\nfseek(fp, position, SEEK_SET); // Move to position \"position\" 10 in the file\n```\n\n#### ftell\nThis tells us where in the file we currently are. In particular, it gives you the byte position we are currently at.\n\n#### rewind\nThis allows us to rewind back to the start of the file!\n\n\n#### ferror\nIndicates whether an error has occurred in working with the file.\n\n#### fgets\nReads one line of input and returns a string.\n\n#### fflufsh\nInput Stream: Disard any data in the buffer that has not been processed yet.\nOutput Stream: Force write all the data in the buffer. Make sure everything has been written out.\n\n---\n\n#### File Descriptors\nEvery time we open a file, there is a file descriptor. This is just a non-negative integer associated with the file. This descriptor describes the state of the file i.e whether is it opened or close. File descriptors helps us keep track of things.\n\nHence, we also have commands such as:\n\n#### Write\n\n```C\nwrite(int fildes, buf, size_t num_bytes);\n```\nHence, if we wanted to print something to stdout\n\n```C\nwrite(1, \"Hello!\", 7);\n// Recall 1 is write/stdout\n```\n\n#### Read\nThis is the same ideas as writing but now we can read in from stdin.\n\n```C\nread(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);\n// Same idea as writing\n\nchar buf[5];\nread(0, buf, 4);\n```\n",

        "content": "\nThis post will be giving the tl;dr version of setting up Python3, virtual environment and github for any projects you may wish to do on MacOSX.\n\n### Intro to Python3 setup\nWe will be using Python3 to develop this project. We will need to install a few things to get this working. Just a heads up, there's currently Python2 which has been around a long time and Python3 which is newer. We will use Python3 since Python2 will be phased out sometime soon.\n\nGood [link](http://www.pyladies.com/blog/Get-Your-Mac-Ready-for-Python-Programming/) first of all for more in depth explanation of everything I'm about to write but you can also just scroll down for tl;dr version: \n\nFirst, need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\nTl;dr, this will allow us to install Python3 and other packages if needed.\n\nTo install Python3, just go:\n```bash\nbrew install python3\n```\n\nInstalling Python3 will automatically install Pip3 as well, which is a package manager for Python3. This will make sure all the libraries you install have all the right dependencies and stuff installed.\n\n---\n\n### Virtual Environments\n\nAfter pip3, we will need to use Virtual environments. Tl;dr think of these as mini operating systems where you can install Python3 packages for each project you do since one project may need different package versions compared to another one. To download the virtual environment package, go:\n```bash\npip3 install virtualenv\n```\n_Note that sometimes online you will see people using the command pip. This refers to installing things for Python2, so instead replace it with pip3 to get installation for Python3_.\n\n\nAfter doing that, we can now create virtual environments! There's a few ways to create venv (virtual environments) but one easy way to get it up and running is to go:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv name_of_env\n```\n\nHere, you can change the name\\_of\\_env to whatever name you want the environment to be. After doing that, you will see a new directory with the name of the environment. This is your virtual environment. To activate the virtual environment, go:\n\n```bash\nsource name_of_env/bin/activate\n```\n\nAgain replace name\\_of\\_env to whatever name it actually is. You will see your terminal prompt now has the name of your environment in the front of it.\n\nNow you can install any Python3 packages you need. Simply go:\n\n```bash\npip3 install package_name\n```\n\nFor example, if we want to install [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), which is a library used quite frequently for data science work, type:\n\n```bash\npip3 install numpy\n```\n\n---\n\nNow sometime we need to make sure that if I use particular packages for a project, that other people know which ones they'll need. We can output the packages we have currently installed in our venv by typing:\n\n```bash\npip3 freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf you look now, you will have a requirements.txt file. You can look at what's inside by typing:\n\n```bash\ncat requirements.txt\n```\n\nIt should show you all the packages you have installed. Upload this file to github whenever you have new stuff installed!\n\nWhen you have finished using the virtual environment, you should deactivate your venv by typing\n\n```bash\ndeactivate\n```\n\nYou should also delete your venv directory before pushing to github (more explanation on what this means) since it'll take up unnecessary space since we are uploading unnecessary stuff on github. Do this by:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf name_of_env\n```\n\nVoila! Should be gone!\n\nSo next time you start up some more coding, follow the process in creating a venv like usual:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv name_of_env\nsource name_of_env/bin/activate\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nWhat the final line does there is for Pip to read in the requirements.txt file and install all the packages in the requirements file. Now when you check what packages you have:\n\n```bash\npip3 freeze\n```\n\nYou should have all the packages installed.\n\n---\n\n### Intro to Github\nThis [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h9_cB9mPT8&list=PLqGj3iMvMa4LFz8DZ0t-89twnelpT4Ilw) is really good introduction to Git and Github. Would recommend you guys to watch this.\n\nTo get started on Github, open your command line and go to the Github repository. In your command line, you can download Github repositories with the general command.\n\n```bash\ngit clone github_link\n```\n\nFor the github_link, go to the main repo, you should see a green button that says clone or download. Click on that and make sure it says \"Clone with HTTPS\". Copy the link under the link and replace the github_link with it. You should now have cloned the repo. You should have a new directory with all the files of the repository inside.\n\nWhenever you finished some code and want to upload it, first make sure you deleted your virtual environment and outputted packages you used into requirements.txt file. Then, first type:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Explanation of stuff you did to the code\"\ngit push\n```\n\nAnd voila! Should be up on Github.\n",
