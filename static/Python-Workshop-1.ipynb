    "Throughout these workshops we are going to be teaching you about programming using a language known as [Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming). Python is a versatile programming language and currently the [third most popular language](https://hackernoon.com/top-3-most-popular-programming-languages-in-2018-and-their-annual-salaries-51b4a7354e06) in the world. Due to its versatility, it is used in a wide range of applications from analysing data, machine learning, web development, and more. Furthermore, it is ranked as the [most popular tool](https://towardsdatascience.com/r-vs-python-vs-matlab-vs-octave-c28cd059aa69) used in analytics/data science by practioners by a wide margin, with R coming in second. Python's popularity stems from its simple programming syntax and the number of developers who contribute to the different packages you can use in the Python ecosystem (more on what this means later). We are going to be utilising a tool known as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.google.com/search?ei=DDYoXN7mDsnTvwTIgLLACA&q=what+is+jupyter+notebook+beginners&oq=what+is+jupyter+notebook+beginners&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i22i29i30.2714.3837..3972...0.0..0.125.996.5j5......0....1..gws-wiz.......0j0i71j0i20i263.JhkvlfrClvM) which allows us to create and share documents with code easily and in a presentable visual format."

The only way you can learn is by *doing*, and it is really important to understand that you will not learn anything unless you activley try and get involved in the examples we present. You will not become an expert in Python by the end of these workshops, but you will become more literate, and in the same way that people who can speak Italian can understand parts of Spanish. These workshops will help your overall ability to program and work with data in a coherent, efficient manner."
