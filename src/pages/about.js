        <p>Whilst students get the opportunity to learn quantitative skills in their Economics units, if they are interested in pursuing topics of research or employment in areas involving data, it is invaluable to know how to code.</p>
        <p> We want to make the Python programming language more accessible for all students in the Economics School. To achieve this, we are running a 6 week workshop on the basics of Python and data science. There is a strong demand by students for programming and data science resources which we aim to meet.</p>
